At Savas, we prioritize a few things. We like people who are enjoyable to work 
with. We like to learn, and teach one another, and sometimes teach others for free. 
We dedicate time for collaboration every week. We allow a flexible work schedule 
as long as we are upholding our commitments to one another and our clients. We 
value openness, over coming in with top-notch experience, though we certainly want
to hear about your experience. We value a work/life balance that we believe improves 
our environment and productivity. We use emoji _a lot_. You **absolutely** don't have to
