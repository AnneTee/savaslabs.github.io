 + There are many others in your shoes
 + Upgrading Drupal is non-trivial so if you're convinced of security implications, seriously consider a comprehensive rebuild
   + Also, your old site probably does stuff you don't want to do anymore, consider D8 for simpler sites
   + Discuss upgrade options
 + Sort of depends on your risk tolerance and how much of a target you are likely to be
   + Caveat is that advanced hacker networks likely have much of the web mapped in that they know what software a corresponding

  + Great thing about Drupal, there are lots of good resources out there
  + Reference Drupalgeddon - every site in the world was destroyed within 7 minutes
  + stomach hurts - https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6-eol#comment-10556816
