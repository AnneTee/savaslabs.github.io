### About working with us
At Savas, we prioritize a few things. We like people who are enjoyable to work 
with. We like to **learn** from and **teach** one another, and often the result is others
 learn as well either via [blog posts](/news), 
 [conference prezzies](http://chrisarusso.github.io/asheville.html#/) or social media.
We dedicate time each week for self-improvement, socializing, and collaboration. 
We encourage a flexible work schedule
so long as we are upholding our commitments to one another and our clients. We 
value **openness**; you are encouraged to be vocal about _not_ knowing something,
and fix it. We are very honest, yet **very respectful**; this is not a cut-throat 
environment.
We take a lot of pride in the quality of our work. We value a work/life **balance** 
that keeps us productive and happy. We like to have **fun**.
We use emoji _a lot_

since **we greatly embrace diversity**!

you need not be physically located nearby to apply. You will often interface
directly with our clients. The position will require proficiency in most aspects 
of Drupal development. You will also have a voice in the kind of work you find 
most rewarding, and we will do what we can to meet your preferences.  
  
Let's start there.
