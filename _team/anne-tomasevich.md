Anne received a B.S. in textile engineering and worked in the clinical research industry for five years before becoming a web developer. She brings to Savas process development, project coordination and client relations skills and is particularly interested in Sass, CSS3, and Object-Oriented CSS. When her laptop is closed, Anne enjoys cooking, playing old Zelda games, and all things musical.
