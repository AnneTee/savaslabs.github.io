summary: Slides from Tim's talk on building web maps using Drupal at the 2015 NACIS conference.
---

Two weeks ago, I gave a presentation on "[Drupalized Web Mapping](http://timstallmann.github.io/nacis-drupal-mapping-talk/#/)" for the [North American Cartographic Information Society 2015](http://www.nacis.org) conference in Minneapolis, MN.
The full set of slides for the talk are [online via Github pages](http://timstallmann.github.io/nacis-drupal-mapping-talk/#/), but here I'm going to skip the "what is Drupal" side of the talk and focus on giving more detail on three different recommended workflows for building web maps in Drupal.

### Leaflet module



### OpenLayers module

### Views GeoJSON + Custom leaflet.js code
