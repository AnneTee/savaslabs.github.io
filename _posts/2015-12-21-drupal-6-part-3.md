## Notes to build off of

Key points for future 

 + There are many others in your shoes
 + Upgrading Drupal is non-trivial so if you're convinced of security implications, seriously consider a comprehensive rebuild
   + Also, your old site probably does stuff you don't want to do anymore, consider D8 for simpler sites
   + Discuss upgrade options
 + Sort of depends on your risk tolerance and how much of a target you are likely to be
   + Caveat is that advanced hacker networks likely have much of the web mapped in that they know what software a corresponding
   URL is on, and can target publicly (or not) known exploits to hit those sites
  + Great thing about Drupal, there are lots of good resources out there
  + Reference Drupalgeddon - every site in the world was destroyed within 7 minutes
  + stomach hurts - https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6-eol#comment-10556816

This can be a hot-button topic. Some technologists are purists, and believe it sacrosanct to even consider.
In the wild, however, given the complexity of site builds, we know most of them take more than 3 months.

Take this snippet from one of the [most prolific Drupal security vulnerabilities](https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003) known to date
> You should proceed under the assumption that every Drupal 7 website was compromised unless updated or patched before Oct 15th, 11pm UTC, that is 7 hours after the announcement.
