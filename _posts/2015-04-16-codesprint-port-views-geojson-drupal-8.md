Triangle-area Drupalers and cartography enthusiasts: please join us from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM on April 24 at the [American Underground @ Main](http://americanunderground.com/). Our team will be working on porting [Views GeoJSON](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_geojson) to Drupal 8.

We'll be updating this post shortly with some additional information on how to prepare for the code sprint â€” tips for setting up a Drupal 8 development environment, what tasks we'll be tackling during the code sprint, and how you can participate remotely if you can't come here in person.

If you're interested to join us, please RSVP to [info@savaslabs.com](mailto:info@savaslabs.com).
