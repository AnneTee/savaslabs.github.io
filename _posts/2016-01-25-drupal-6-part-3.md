## The options of operating Drupal 6 after EOL

<img src="/assets/img/options.jpg" alt="options">

 
## Intro
Though some advisers (solicited or not) might tell you otherwise, you _always_ have options as to what to do
with your website if you're running Drupal. One of them is of course nothing, and the others require more thought.

This can be a hot-button topic. Some technologists are purists, and believe it sacrosanct to even consider
running software after beyond EOL. However, we appreciate
that although ideally site owners would always have been prepared and budgeted for 
software upgrades, sometimes life happens.

One end of the spectrum I think is well captured by what some (certainly not us :wink:) may consider the 
alarmist reaction to one of the [most prolific Drupal security vulnerabilities to-date](https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003) colloquially referred to as "Drupalgeddon"

> You should proceed under the assumption that every Drupal 7 website was compromised unless updated or patched before Oct 15th, 11pm UTC, that is 7 hours after the announcement.

This obviously can be anxiety provoking and ["Le dendrite"](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6-eol#comment-10556816) is not wrong to say:

That [entire thread](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6-eol) is a 
pretty good expos√© into the various perspectives and preparedness
on upgrading Drupal 6 sites. If you've got a spare half-day, give it a once-over.



On the _other hand_, we have had at least two clients in 2015 who continued to run Drupal 5 
websites in production successfully. 

Neither end is entirely wrong, they just represent difference of opinion and available options.


Whether your hosting provider is mandating it, or you've decided it's finally time for a redesign
and you're going to finish off your Drupal 6 site once and for all

### The primary options for Drupal 6 site owners are
1. Do not upgrade your website to a newer Drupal version
1. Upgrade your website to a newer Drupal version
1. Redesign / revision your website altogether


How you decide what to do with those options rests on
 + Your risk tolerance
 + How much of a target you are likely to be
 + Your budget to do something about it



##### Not upgrading considerations:
    1. Harden existing site
    
##### Upgrading considerations

So you're resolve to upgrade, eh? This is usually the right option for you if you
 + Want to mostly preserve the site as-is
 + decide you ought to be using supported software because you
    + have sensitive information within your site that would be disastrous if compromised 
    + have financial transactions or information housed within your site.
 + Have sufficient budget to do the work.
 
 What should you upgrade to, Drupal 7 or 8? Ah-ah-ah...

 that's for the next episode
        1. There you have two options at present with a Drupal 6 site discussed in part 4

    

How complex is your site? 
Most vulnerability is from custom code, and under-supported contributed code since
core code has been well vetted by years in the wild.

Consider at least getting a site audit if you can pay a firm for a small chunk
of time to do a high-level analysis

Upgrading Drupal is non-trivial so if you're convinced of security implications, seriously consider a comprehensive rebuild

If you've determined you have a substantial enough budget to do 



##### Redesign/revision considerations

 + Is there some content you want to keep?
 + Do you have a complex data architecture?
 
 If you answer yes to either, a content migration may be the best


 + Sort of depends on 
   + Caveat is that advanced hacker networks likely have much of the web mapped in that they know what software a corresponding
   URL is on, and can target publicly (or not) known exploits to hit those sites

### Part 4 and beyond

Next, we'll discuss Drupal 7 vs. Drupal 8 decision-making (or not Drupal at all!).
