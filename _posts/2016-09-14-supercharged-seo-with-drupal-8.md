Here at Savas Labs, when it comes to developing systems, our focus is not only to code according to best practices, but also deliver a solid marketing vehicle to our clients and partners. Let’s be honest here - perfectly coded, a pretty looking website will be of little use if it doesn’t produce leads / facilitate conversions or generate revenue! So how do we achieve those goals? We get there by balancing website objectives while giving priority to lead generation via SEO. The more quality traffic that comes to the website - the more conversions we can achieve. It’s that simple! 

There are multiple ways of generating traffic to a website. The most popular are SEO (search engine optimization) and PPC (Pay Per Click). Both bring traffic through search engines. The difference between the two is that SEO brings long-term results boosting organic traffic while PPC helps marketers achieve short-term goals by gaining instant exposure throughout the duration of the ad campaign.

In this post I’ll share some insight about current trends of SEO. I’ll also describe new features of  Drupal 8 that make it the most SEO-friendly content management framework available today.

Let’s take a look at what exactly Search Engine Optimization is.

## What is SEO?

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a marketing discipline focused on optimizing a website’s architecture and content so that it performs well (read “ranks high”) in organic search engine results.

Search engines (Google, Bing, etc.) are changing their search algorithms many times throughout the year. There are over 200 ranking factors that become updated with every algorithmic change. Having said that, we begin to realize that there are many techniques that website owners can use to optimize their digital property for search engine consumption. So where do we start? How do we know what efforts will bring us the best ROI and let our marketers do their job effectively in the long run?

## SEO Outlook 2017

The Savas Labs team stays dialed in on the current trends of Search Engines Optimization. Our own experiences with SEO, trials and errors and aggregated research data helped us develop sound judgment and solid knowledge of the current marketing landscape.

Here are 4 ranking factors that we identified as being most important as of Q4 2016. Our forecast is that those 4 factors will likely remain at the top of the list throughout 2017.

#### 1. Content

Content is still king! Yes, that’s right. It is and it will always be! You’ve got to be relevant in order to even appear in search. And nothing will make you more relevant than carefully crafted, practical, awesome, juicy, shareable, actionable (you name it) CONTENT!

#### 2. Backlinks

Not just any good ‘ol link to your website. [Good backlinks](cognitiveseo.com/blog/3057/the-definition-of-the-high-quality-backlink/) come from high authority domains that are in the same niche as your website. Strong backlinks bring quality traffic and are therefore considered highly desirable to your SEO cause.

#### 3. Responsive Design

With more people using their handheld devices to browse the internet, it has become increasingly important to make a website look good across multiple platforms (smartphone, tablet, etc.). It is not an option in 2017 - it is a necessity! While we won’t get into the notoriously labeled [Google algorithm update “Mobilegeddon”](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/04/rolling-out-mobile-friendly-update.html) that happened in April 2015, we will provide some interesting statistics to back up the importance of responsive design.

> “There are more mobile internet users than desktop internet users; 52.7% of global internet users access the internet via mobile, and 75.1% of U.S. internet users access the internet via mobile.”

> “4 out of 5 consumers use a Smartphone to shop.”

#### 4. Page Speed

In response to the substantial increase in mobile traffic growth, search engines have acknowledged the importance of page speed and the effect it has on user experience (UX) and now give more weight to fast-loading websites.

> “40% of people abandon a website that takes more than 3 seconds to load.”

> “a 2-second delay in load time during a transaction resulted in abandonment rates of up to 87%. This is significantly higher than the baseline abandonment rate of 67%.”
Can your business handle the loss in revenue that may occur from slow page load speed?

## Drupal 8 - Built with SEO in Mind

 The base of all our SEO efforts lies within the website’s architecture. There are many website engines and CMS’s to choose from and most of them will claim that they are SEO optimized. Don’t be fooled! No CMS will come search engine optimized out of the box. It may have some features, which, if configured correctly, may bring you some SEO benefits. SEO is not only about code, though it does start there. SEO is also about the continuous efforts of your marketing team. We all know that time = money. The more efficient your marketing team is in performing tasks within your CMS - the more ROI you get!
 
 A good CMS must provide means for your marketing team to work independently from your development team. Drupal 8 does just that! It provides solid framework that can be tuned to become a powerful marketing-machine.
 
 Let’s take a look at some of the new feature in core that make search engines love Drupal 8.
 
#### Drupal 8 is Responsive out of the Box

Drupal 8 comes with responsive themes in core. Now both public facing and admin facing themes are responsive and make user experience great on any device.

#### Drupal 8 Page Load is Fast

No! Not out the box! In fact vanilla Drupal 8 is running much more code than vanilla Drupal 7. It runs vendor code like Symfony, which adds some overhead. However, Drupal 8 has a number of improvements that are making up for that overhead:

- **Javascript files are now loading in the footer**. Due to this change pages build up faster and user can see and use them earlier.

- **[Pluggable CSS/JS aggregation and minification](https://www.drupal.org/node/2034675)** to support more optimal optimization algorithms

- **Highly improved caching**. Drupal 8 uses “cache tags” that makes caching more efficient and includes Cache Context API which provides context-based caching. This means pages load faster while ensuring that visitors always see the latest version of your site.

- **BigPipe render pipeline**. Sends pages in a way that allows browsers to show them much faster. First sends the cacheable parts of the page, then the dynamic/uncacheable parts. Uses the [BigPipe technique](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/bigpipe-pipelining-web-pages-for-high-performance/389414033919).

These improvements have the potential to make your Drupal 8 website fly! And if after all that it is not “flying” - than you need someone to review the code that powers your website’s features. ([Contact us](savaslabs.com/contact/))

#### Semantic Markup

Search engines appreciate clean markup that explicitly describes the purpose of on-page elements. Thanks to [HTML5 Initiative](https://www.drupal.org/community-initiatives/drupal-core/html5) for Drupal 8 development, we now have a number of great markup improvements right in Drupal core:

- HTML5 themes with new semantic elements in core templates

- Support for the new form elements to Drupal's Form API

- Rich media handling with \<video> and \<audio> elements

- ARIA roles in markup to improve accessibility

- Twig theming engine - makes it harder for developers to create messy, non-semantic code

#### Content as a Service

Another exciting new feature of Drupal 8 is a flexible content delivery.

It enables Drupal to create and deliver content as a service to any channel (aggregators, apps. other sites, etc.) or device. No longer is your content restricted to residing on your website only. Decoupled, or “headless” Drupal can power your apps while letting you control all the content from a unified admin interface.

#### Drupal 8  Multilingual Capabilities

Previous versions of Drupal had partial support for multilingual websites. Luckily, Drupal 8 had a fundamental overhaul of its [multilingual system](www.drupal8multilingual.org/features). Every single component is translatable out of the box in Drupal core without any additional modules. Drupal core natively supports 94 languages. Also, the administration interface is now entirely translatable. Media assets (files or images), can now be assigned to a language or shared between languages. This gives a huge advantage to businesses that aim to reach global audience.

SEO for Drupal 8 is off to a good start with just the core features! Drupal 8 also has a growing number of contributed modules that can amplify your SEO efforts. Just to name a few: [Metatags](https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag), [Google Analytics](https://www.drupal.org/project/google_analytics), [Pathauto](https://www.drupal.org/project/pathauto), [Redirect](https://www.drupal.org/project/redirect), and more.
