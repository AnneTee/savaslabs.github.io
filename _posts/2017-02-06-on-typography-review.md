  A review of Jason Santa Maria's *On Web Typography*, and how we applied the
  lessons learned to our workflow.
---

As a developer who often interacts with and creates web designs, I'm always on
the lookout for quality resources to level up my design skills, and the [Book
Apart series](https://abookapart.com/) has proven to be an excellent source of
knowledge presented in a relevant, concise manner. My latest read was [*On Web
Typography* by Jason Santa Maria](https://abookapart.com/products/on-web-typography),
I found the book to be a great resource, especially for the non-designer, and
have detailed below my biggest take-aways and some ways that the Savas Labs team
has implemented the lessons we've learned.

## The review

### Thinking about reading

Have you ever stopped to think about the actual process of reading? I think
Santa Maria put it best:

> Reading is something we do every day, but we can easily take it for granted. Slapping words on a page won’t ensure good communication, just as mashing your hands across a piano won’t make for a pleasant composition. The experience of reading and the effectiveness of our message are determined by both what we say and how we say it.

Rather than jumping into choosing and pairing typefaces, or even evaluating
their characteristics, Santa Maria suggests we approach the process much further
back and take the time to consider what users are actually doing when they read
text on our sites. This is something I hadn't considered before and brings a
depth to the process that is so much more than picking and applying fonts.

### Base knowledge

Most of us can tell a serif from a sans-serif, but I found the base of knowledge
Santa Maria provides in the book to be an incredibly useful foundation. Knowing
some critical terminology and history has already improved my ability to design
type, and this section is compact enough to be a quick overview with a serious
payoff.

In this section, Santa Maria covers:

- An extremely brief yet useful history of type, focused on how typefaces were
created through most of history before the web and how things changed as the
world became digital
- Terminology used to describe typefaces and their elements
- Methods for classifying typefaces that are descriptive and useful when
evaluating and choosing typefaces
- An overview of the characters and styles that a well-developed typeface will
offer (true bolds and italics, language sets, punctuation, etc.)

### Evaluating typefaces

After reviewing the building blocks that make up a typeface, Santa Maria applies
this knowledge by walking the reader through the process of evaluating two
classic typefaces. This section was crucial for me to learn how to pick apart a
typeface and understand its geometric structure, tone, history, and classification.
Santa Maria also demonstrates how one can capitalize on the tried-and-tested
nature of classic typefaces by looking to revivals and alternatives inspired by
those classics.

### Choosing and pairing typefaces

All the previous sections culminate in the ultimate goal: how to choose
typefaces. One of the hardest-hitting concepts here is two separate contexts to
consider: *type for a moment* (a menu link, a heading, etc.) and *type to live
with* (long text). These contexts will demand different typeface choices based
on what's important to the reader - quickly ascertaining a snippet of text, or
reading long swaths of text without becoming fatigued or distracted.

Santa Maria provides some helpful step-by-step methods for choosing typefaces.
My favorite was word association, something we may all be familiar with, but he
built this process out in a way that seems effective and easy.

Another important skill covered is pairing typefaces, something that has been a
challenge for me to pick up as I've continued to delve into web design. Santa
Maria suggests a balance between two typeface's distinction from each other and
cohesion with each other, demonstrated with numerous examples, and explained with
reference to the type terminology and classifications reviewed previously.

## What's next?

After finishing the book, I had a couple of questions:

### How can I actively improve my type design skills?

After reading the book, I felt armed with a wealth of information, but unsure of
how I'd be able to apply it. I've found that improving design skills isn't
something that happens instantly after you've learned something new — it
takes practice!

One of the methods I've found most useful is to keep an eye out for
design elements I like, and when I see them, breaking them down and figuring out
why they work. For typography, this would mean identifying the context,
classifying the typeface, evaluating the letterforms to identify their physical
characteristics and the feelings they invoke, and — most importantly —
bookmarking the source in an "Inspiration" folder. [Entire books have been
written about this process](http://austinkleon.com/steal/), so don't be afraid
to be inspired by others' work!

Once I'm feeling inspired, I follow these guidelines when designing type:

- Keep it simple. It's conventional to use a maximum of two typefaces, and often
using typefaces within the same family or a single typeface in multiple styles
gives you all the variety you need.
- Try things out in context. This is recommended by Santa Maria in the book, and
giving typefaces and pairings a shot on your actual site (or a local version) is
crucial. Most paid fonts are available via free trials, so no excuses!

### How can our team apply this knowledge?

Much of the team at Savas Labs focused on back-end development, but we all have
a desire to be holistic teammates with some proficiency at every stage of the
process. For most of us, the goal is to be able to consult on typography and
make informed decisions on type design when needed. We don't all have the time
to invest in becoming typography experts — one can spend an entire career
doing so — so we wanted resources


> Being good at typography makes you a more adept thinker, communicator, and designer. When you immerse yourself in the fine details of text, you not only make yourself aware of those details and how they affect communication, but you also put yourself in your readers’ shoes.
