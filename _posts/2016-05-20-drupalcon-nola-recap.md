A week full of summits, sessions, a presentation, some parties and a fair amount of tweeting <img src="/assets/icons/twitter-bird.svg" height="24" alt="Twitter bird"> was one for the books at Drupalcon NOLA 2016. Come along for a Twitter-assisted chronological journey for Savas Labs in New Orleans.

### Saturday / Sunday: Arrive, play soccer, get acquainted

I arrived Saturday evening after a few short flights from Durham, NC. My gracious host and boots on the ground in NOLA Kevin Harrison lent me a bicycle, showed me around the city, and invited me to play in his soccer game. It was a comforting entry into a new city that closely resembled what my weekend would have been like if I were at home. Thanks a ton Kevin for the hospitality!

 Kevin also took me to the convention center so I could get my bearings for the week ahead. He took my picture, and **_every so slightly_** doctored up the version you see below for me to share with my community that we had made it!

### Monday - Business Summit / Opening party

Thanks to Kevin for my two wheels, this is what my commute looked like most days to and from the conference. Despite the condition of some roads, New Orleans has one of the highest ([sixth according to the 2009 census](http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/10/biking_new_orleans_might_be_le.html)) rates of citizens who commute by bicycle in the U.S. It's clearly also fairly horse-friendly as well.

 After arriving, I walked the .75 miles (no exaggeration... it's 1 mile long) **_inside_** the convention center to get to the business summit. Although a little disorganized due to a last-minute personnel change of who would be running the summit, it proved to be a very open forum where leaders in in the Drupal community spoke very openly, honestly, and encouragingly about how they run their Drupal businesses. It was refreshing how genuinely the open source philosophy pervaded the consciousness of the leaders who were on panels and giving presentations.

 In between panels and presentations, the rest of us divvied up into smaller groups brainstorming around key issues and presented our collective expertise back to the larger group. Topics ranged from content strategy, to marketing tactics, to how to handle conflict with large personalities, and everything in between. The breadth of the coverage ensured that nearly everyone got something out of the summit. My reading list grew by an order of magnitude from the summit. Now if I could only find the time...
 
 After the summit, I joined my teammates [Lisa](team/lisa-ridley/) and [Kosta](team/kosta-harlan/) at the opening reception. This was the first opportunity to see former coworkers and members of the community we were  personally acquainted with before the conference.
 
 We then headed to the welcome pub crawl to meet up with some Drupal friends in person for the first time. It was a great evening of beautiful weather, good beer, and excited Drupalist(a)(o)s eagerly anticipating a fun week.

### Tuesday - Presentation / Women in Drupal 

Excited (and a bit nervous) to give [my first presentation at Drupalcon]() (e pluribus unum), I spent much of the day reviewing and updating slides that were impacted by [the Driesnote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ksp5JVFryEg) which  

Since Drupalcon is primarily a developer's conference, and I was speaking in the "Business" track, I decided to drum up some interest for the session with a little social media <s>mudslinging</s> banter.

A couple favorites are: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is <a href="https://twitter.com/acquia">@acquia</a>&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/HornCologne">@horncologne</a> secretly involved with <a href="https://twitter.com/Jamroom">@Jamroom</a> CMS?<br><br>Sifting through the rumors today <a href="https://twitter.com/5">@5</a>:00 <a href="https://twitter.com/DrupalConNA">@DrupalConNA</a> <a href="https://t.co/T4sQ5Pmbih">https://t.co/T4sQ5Pmbih</a></p>&mdash; Savas Labs (@Savas_Labs) <a href="https://twitter.com/Savas_Labs/status/730096335748206592">May 10, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I must admit, since we have a [Jam](/team/kosta-harlan) of our own (inquire within), Acquia's Jam is a topic of frequent discussion at the Savas Labs water cooler. I <s>was</s> still am hopeful for a reaction. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">TBD today <a href="https://twitter.com/5">@5</a>:00 <a href="https://twitter.com/DrupalConNA">@DrupalConNA</a> <a href="https://t.co/VODC0fZ65P">https://t.co/VODC0fZ65P</a><br><br>What&#39;s the best/worst named CMS?<br>Farcry<br>Geeklog<br>Thingamablog<a href="https://twitter.com/TiddlyWiki">@TiddlyWiki</a> (my fave)</p>&mdash; Savas Labs (@Savas_Labs) <a href="https://twitter.com/Savas_Labs/status/730087801790828545">May 10, 2016</a></blockquote>

Just a select few of the **incredible** names _someone_ decided to name their CMS in the past. Most of which have little to no presence at this point. You live and learn. 

#### Women in Drupal

Somewhat ironically, Kosta and myself and not Lisa (the only female Savasian at Drupalcon) attended the [Women in Drupal](https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/women-drupal) event. It was a great time to meet some [old friends](http://devcollaborative.com/about-us) in person for the first time and make some new friends. It was nice to see the women-owned [hook 42](http://www.hook42.com/) as sponsorship leaders who were presenting the day before at the business summit. It's also great that this has been on the Drupalcon agenda for years. It was also nice to hear people talking of diversity beyond gender as a focus for Drupal agencies and technology companies more generally. However much like evaluations from my session were helpful in pointing out room for improvement, my two cents is that a better platform for meaningful discussion that can lead to action is interesting to me. On the flipside, as my teammates pointed out, there's nothing wrong with having a party. Thank you to the sponsors and Drupal community for caring about this issue.


### Wednesday - Sessions and Lullabot Party

After the presentation was behind me, I was happy to be more involved with the daily activities of Drupalcon, i.e. **attending sessions!**. I went to a handful, but my favorite of the day was [Lessons from Wordpress Core](https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/lessons-wordpress-core). It was a nice discussion of the pros and cons of Wordpress and Drupal powered websites given by two [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io/) employees who had respective expertise in one of the frameworks. One primary takeaway for me was the discrepancy in approach with Drupal vs. Wordpress in backward compatibility. It is a _very_ complex topic, but in some ways the backwards compatible approach has contributed to Wordpress's high degree of user-loyalty as well as comparatively fast adoption to the newest version. The Drupal leadership is very conscious of this and is having very meaningful conversations around Backwards compatibility. Larry Garrield ([Crell](https://www.drupal.org/u/crell)) [provides great insight to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeoCHqzvUFY&feature=youtu.be&t=3296) at the end of the session.
