### About working with us
At Savas, we prioritize a few things. We like people who are enjoyable to work 
with. We like to **learn** from and **teach** one another, and often the result is others
 learn as well either via [blog posts](/news), 
 [conference prezzies](http://chrisarusso.github.io/asheville.html#/) or social media.
We dedicate time each week for self-improvement, socializing, and collaboration. 
We encourage a flexible work schedule
so long as we are upholding our commitments to one another and our clients. We 
value **openness**; you are encouraged to be vocal about _not_ knowing something,
and fix it. We are very honest, yet **very respectful**; this is not a cut-throat 
environment.
We take a lot of pride in the quality of our work. We value a work/life **balance** 
that keeps us productive and happy. We like to have **fun**.
We use emoji _a lot_
