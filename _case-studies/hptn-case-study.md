project_title: HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) Site Redesign
tags: css design drupal drupal8 durham front-end-dev module-development performance sass theming user-experience
client_name: HIV Prevention Trials Network
client_url: "https://www.hptn.org"
client_description: |
  [The HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN)](https://www.hptn.org) is a worldwide collaborative clinical trials network that brings together investigators, ethicists, community and other partners to develop and test the safety and efficacy of interventions designed to prevent the acquisition and transmission of HIV.
client_dates: 2015 - present
client_quote: |
  Leadership loves the new website. They had zero concerns or commentary other than being impressed. Awesome, guys.

project_description: |
  When the HIV Prevention Trials Network aimed to update to a modern, mobile-friendly, easy-to-maintain website, they started evaluating the capabilities of various content management systems that would meet their needs. They settled on Drupal 8.
project_highlights: [Responsive web design, UX design, Drupal 8, Client server integration]
project_objective: |
  For the redesign, HPTN prioritized providing their users with a clean, modern site that loads easily on mobile devices in areas of the world with less-than-optimal bandwidth, and to provide their content editors with a powerful, easy-to-use content management interface. They also needed to connect with their Microsoft SQL server to pull data on studies, study sites, publications, and network members.
project_process: |
  Working with HPTN stakeholders, Savas Labs created a responsive design that would best serve each of HPTN's user groups, especially those accessing the site on mobile devices, and implemented that design in a custom Drupal 8 theme. Savas Labs heavily relied on Drupal content entities to pull and display data coming from legacy HPTN systems, and leveraged both Drupal and external caching mechanisms to ensure prompt delivery of requests to end users.
project_results: |
  Thanks to an integrated approach in which Savas Labs worked closely with the client, the new site launched in time for the HPTN Annual Conference, the ongoing maintenance and administration of the content decreased dramatically, and both the corporate site maintainers and the remote users reaped the benefits of the easily navigable, mobile-friendly delivery of data.

## Designing with intention

Our design process is more than making things look good. To create a visual
design, site architecture, and user experience that would signify a drastic
improvement over their previous site and would serve their user base for years
to come, we started by carefully gathering critical information from the HPTN
team about their vision and goals.

### Determining project and business-level goals

The beginning of any project at Savas Labs involves identifying and prioritizing
goals not only directly related to the project, but on a holistic level relative
to the client's business. Determining these goals and agreeing upon them at the
very beginning allows us to base the entire process, from design to coding to
deployment and any scope change that may come up in between, on what's really
important to the client on both short and long term bases. 

Before diving into the web design process, we spent time with the HPTN team
learning about what they wanted from the project and how it reflected their
ultimate goals as a nonprofit. The HPTN team wanted a modern, responsive design
and a user-friendly interface, built upon the latest technologies - namely,
Drupal 8. To best engage their user base, they wanted an easy-to-use content
editing interface so they could keep the site constantly updated with fresh and
relevant content.

On a larger scale, the HPTN team knew it was important for us to plan beyond the
"ideal" user on the latest device with the fastest connection, since
many of their users are on older devices in areas of the world with slower
internet connections. We would need to present a seamless experience for these
users, which meant avoiding a dependence on Javascript for critical interactions
and ensuring great site performance. Ultimately, we needed to make sure the site
could, for years to come, serve the HPTN's purpose: to be an easily accessed and
navigable central location for news, resources, and information relevant to the
HPTN community.

### Creating and honing a new look



- Styleguide
- Branding/logo design

### Navigating site architecture through wireframing



Discuss the project goals more in depth and include how the goals were formed
with the client, how the goals were to be measured from beginning to end, and
how Savas Labs worked with the client to meet those goals. Describe how the
project was run from a PM standpoint and how SL was able to guide the client
through the process with transparency and expertise. Review how SL works and
how our methodology applied to this project specifically.

## Discussion of design process and user experience consulting

Here we can highlight our design process and describe how we worked with the
client to capture their needs within the design. We can highlight modern tools
and design paradigms used in the process. We can also discuss UX design and
describe our process and its benefits.




## Theme development

- We can go into a lot of detail here about integrating the styleguide with the theme, the tools we chose to use, and the fact that we built a custom theme completely from scratch
- Talk about the benefits of D8 theming

## Content management experience

## Integration with MsSQL server

## Demonstrate benefit received by the client

Something about "next steps" or "future collaboration?" or a summary?

We referred to these goals constantly throughout
the project, and reflect on these goals with the client as we continue our
relationship post-launch. Using HPTN's principles to guide us as we prioritize
work and make design decisions has helped us hone the website into something of
great value to HPTN's team of content editors and stakeholders and to the
network members they serve.

If we captured metrics such as performance profiling, Google analytics, etc.
we can share them here. We can also discuss less tangible results, such as
client satisfaction, improved user experience, improved design, better
adherence to modern design or accessibility standards, etc.

## Discuss positive outcomes for the company

If we have positive outcomes on our end from the project, we can highlight them
here. Some examples would be a positive experience with a new technology that we
look forward to using with other clients, working on a project that we believe
does good in the world, or successfully employing a project management workflow.
This is something often not included on other agencies' sites, but it fits
with our personable, honest brand. Note that this isn't a place to say that we
messed up and learned from it, or that we filled a gap in our knowledge. We want
this to reflect well on the company!
