project_description: |
  After multiple organizational transitions left Duke's flagship news outlet's redesign incomplete and in need of a new development team, Savas Labs stepped in to deliver a complex content migration, building on top of other agencies' code, all within four months!
project_objective: |
 Given the lengthy project history which had gone through two development agencies, by the time Savas Labs was brought in by design partner and fellow Durham natives Cuberis, our edict was to deliver the finished product ASAP. While appreciating the urgency, we didn't cut corners, and provided insights into best practices for performance, monitoring and security.
project_process: |
  To assess status and effort remaining, we began with a standard audit assessing system quality and functional completion. Once we were better oriented with organizational goals and the work that remained, we charged ahead on weekly development sprints. We collaborated daily with the Cuberis team to ensure user experience and design carried as much weight as the functional improvements we implemented. We staged work on Duke's cutting-edge custom hosting infrastructure using Docker containerization to enlist consistent feedback from all stakeholders throughout.
project_results: |
 With attention to the project's urgency, we delivered the quality the Duke brand demands efficiently and expediently, and the results were celebrated across the University. In four months, we took sixteen years and 120,000 articles worth of rich inter-departmental content and, with Cuberis's help, made it more engaging and accessible for all users.

## The long version

### Talk about importance of project/executing on time

### Migration

- Detail everything we migrated: so many nodes with refactored content types with tons of fields, very complex tags that were also refactored, tons of files
- Use numbers - maybe include a table?
 - 23593 files
 - 100421 nodes (13 content types)
 - 115 taxonomy terms
- Mention that it was important to migrate basically 100% of content, all the way back to year 2000

Possibly also discuss how a more strategic migration strategy makes sense in other cases in which you only port over, for example, the top 10% but they needed/wanted it all so it was worth substantial investment

### Feeds?

### Docker - development and deployment
