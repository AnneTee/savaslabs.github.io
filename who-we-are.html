    <h3>What Does Savas Mean?</h3>
    <p>
        The name Savas derives its route from the French word <i>savoir</i> which means "to know". Savas is also a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome" target="_blank" >palindrome</a>, 
which means it is read forward and backward the same, and implies balance and symmetry. Together, an informed, and balanced approach speaks to how we collaborate with our clients to produce sound solutions.
