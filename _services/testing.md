<i class="fa fa-check-circle-o fa-2x fa-pull-left"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Testing. Every site needs it, but all too often in the industry this comes down to a time-consuming and tedious process of manually clicking through pages on the site.

The Savas team takes a different approach. We use automated tests in [Behat](http://behat.org), [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de), [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org) and others, and integrate them with [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org) and [Travis](http://travis-ci.org). We pride ourselves on delivering stable, secure, and tested code.
