[Our team](/team) has built dozens of Drupal sites. We understand the value of sustainable code and write Drupal coding standards compliant PHP, JavaScript, and CSS. We have a thorough knowledge of best practices for deploying small and large scale Drupal sites. We're skilled in all aspects of development, from back-end to large scale data migration, from theming to automated testing.

We provide professional Drupal training to clients in the Triangle area. Our standard curriculum covers Drupal module development, map making with Drupal, site building, and theming basics. We can also custom-tailor a class for your needs.

Our team has rescued poorly-built Drupal implementations and refactored legacy, bug-ridden code to be secure and reliable. We have also done security audits for clients, both to prevent hacks, and as part of a hack recovery process. (None of the sites we manage were compromised by [DrupalGeddon](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupalgeddon).)

Savas believes in giving back to the community. Several of our team members contribute patches and maintain modules on [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org), and in 2015 Savas will be organizing Drupal code sprints in Durham.
