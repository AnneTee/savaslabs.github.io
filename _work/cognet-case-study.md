project_description: |
  After building a custom Drupal 7 theme based on Zurb Foundation, Savas went back to the drawing board to redesign the site for small screens, resulting in a seamless, responsive experience across devices.
project_objective: |
  As a next phase in development following the site's relaunch in May 2015, MIT Press CogNet wanted to extend their site to users of all devices. A complete responsive redesign was in order.
project_process: |
  Savas worked with the CogNet team to develop basic wireframes, then capitalized on the power of the Zurb Foundation theme and Sass for CSS preprocessing to rework the already-existing subtheme. To ensure a seamless experience on smaller devices, Savas used jQuery to create slick navigation, scrolling, and content exploration.
project_results: |
  MIT Press CogNet went from a desktop-only site to a clean, modern, easy to navigate site on all screen sizes. Thanks to our strong partnership with the client, effective planning, and the powerful technologies used, this project was delivered under-budget.
