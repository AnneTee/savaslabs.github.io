MIT Press CogNet is the essential online resource for students and scholars in the brain and cognitive sciences. Since its launch in 2000, it quickly became the premiere source for those engaged in highly-cited, cutting-edge research. Savas developers built out the Drupal theme design provided by MIT Press for the relaunch of the site in Drupal 7 (coming later in 2015), and refactored legacy code to use Drupal 7 APIs and follow best practices.
